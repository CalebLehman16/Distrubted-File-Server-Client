This is a Distributed File Service with a client and server setup. Run the servers using the run_servers.sh script. The client can make a GET request, where it will recieve the requested file, a PUT request, where the server will chunk the file across multiple servers, giving redundancy in the case of partial server shutdown, and LS, where it will list all files on the server.
